# DeepLearning_MIMO-NOMA



> hi, guys. I`m Jeongwoo Do in *** EE

> The repository is realization of MIMO_NOMA signal detection system based on **C. Lin et al., “A deep learning approach for MIMO-NOMA downlink signal detection,” MDPI Sensors, vol. 19, no. 11, pp. 2526, 2019. ** and traditional detection shceme to compare performance.
